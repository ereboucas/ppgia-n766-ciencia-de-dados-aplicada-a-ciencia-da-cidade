# Final Assessment Project Ideas

## Project Ideas for Fortaleza, CE

### 1. **Accessibility & Service Coverage Analysis**
**Topics**: Isochrone Mapping + Voronoi Diagrams
- Map healthcare facilities (UPAs, hospitals) in Fortaleza
- Generate isochrone zones (15-min walking/driving access)
- Create Voronoi tessellation to identify service gaps
- Analyze which neighborhoods have poor healthcare accessibility

### 2. **Urban Violence Scaling in Ceará**
**Topics**: Scaling Analysis (β exponent) + Zipf's Law
- Collect homicide data for municipalities in Ceará (including Fortaleza)
- Perform scaling analysis: does violence scale superlinearly with city size?
- Apply Zipf's law to rank Ceará cities by crime rates
- Compare Fortaleza's position to theoretical predictions

### 3. **Public Transport Connectivity & Resilience**
**Topics**: Percolation Theory + Isochrone Mapping
- Model Fortaleza's bus network as a graph
- Simulate removal of stations/routes to find percolation threshold
- Generate isochrones showing coverage before/after disruptions
- Identify critical infrastructure for network resilience

### 4. **Neighborhood Growth Patterns**
**Topics**: Gibrat's Law + Random Walk
- Analyze population growth in Fortaleza neighborhoods (2000-2020)
- Test if growth rates are independent of initial size
- Use random walk models to predict future expansion patterns
- Identify which areas are growing faster/slower than expected

### 5. **Beach Access Equity Analysis**
**Topics**: Voronoi Diagrams + Isochrone Mapping
- Map Fortaleza's beach access points
- Create Voronoi regions showing "nearest beach" zones
- Generate isochrones (30-min walking/cycling/transit)
- Identify neighborhoods with poor beach accessibility

### 6. **Socioeconomic Segregation Patterns**
**Topics**: Schelling Model + Voronoi Diagrams
- Get income/education data by neighborhood in Fortaleza
- Simulate Schelling-like dynamics with actual spatial configuration
- Use Voronoi diagrams to analyze spatial clustering
- Compare model predictions with real segregation patterns

### 7. **Business Distribution & Power Laws**
**Topics**: Zipf's Law + Scaling Analysis
- Scrape/collect data on business types in Fortaleza (restaurants, pharmacies, etc.)
- Test if business counts follow power law distributions by neighborhood
- Analyze how commercial activity scales with neighborhood population
- Identify over/under-served areas

### 8. **Mobility Patterns in Historical Center**
**Topics**: Random Walk + Percolation Theory
- Model pedestrian movement in Fortaleza's Centro using random walks
- Apply percolation to study walkability network connectivity
- Identify which street closures would fragment the walking network
- Suggest improvements for pedestrian accessibility

## Recommended Starters

**Easiest**: #5 (Beach Access) - straightforward data, clear visualization

**Most Impactful**: #1 (Healthcare Access) - policy-relevant, clear gaps

**Most Theoretical**: #4 (Growth Patterns) - tests fundamental urban theory

## Data Sources

All projects can use open data sources:
- **IBGE** - population, demographics, geographic boundaries
- **DataSUS** - health facilities, health statistics
- **OpenStreetMap** - street networks, POIs, facilities
- **Fortaleza Transparency Portal** - municipal data
- **IPECE** - Ceará state statistics
- **Atlas Brasil** - HDI, income, education data by municipality
